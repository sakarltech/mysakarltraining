Write me a bash script to automate the creation of a placeholder branch and a feature branch for starting a feature work with the workflow provided below:
!/bin/bash
git checkout $current-release-branch
git pull
git checkout -b features/$ticket_number-create-placeholder-$feature
git push --set-upstream origin features/$ticket_number-create-placeholder-$feature
brfeature $feature  --user-stories 1
mv features/$feature
rmdir features
git add features/$feature/
git commit -m "features/$ticket_number-create-placeholder-$feature" features/$feature/
git push
